## Web Design for Everybody Capstone
This repository is specifically for the Web Design Specialization for Everybody Capstone Project. 

The capstone was to develop a professional-quality web portfolio, allowing us to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a responsive site for a minimum of three platforms.  

The site needed to accomplish the following:
* validate
* be responsive
* be well-styled
* incorporate images effectively
* add elements to our site that are unique

We were to create our website either from scratch, from a template, or through the use of a framework. I chose to build by website from scratch and am hosting it on [GitHub](https://shelby-hagstrom.github.io/)
